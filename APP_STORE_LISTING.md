A split-flap clock that slaps.

## Description

Remember those gorgeous clocks at the airport? The ones with the mechanical digits that flip down with a satisfying *clack*? Yeah, we turned that into an app. You're welcome.

**Meet Tock** — a split-flap clock for your iPhone and iPad that's so beautiful you'll check the time just to watch it move.

**The real deal.**
Every digit flips with physics-driven animation — gravity pull, overshoot, bounce, settle. We didn't just animate a number change. We simulated the whole mechanical dance. The colon pulses. The digits cascade on launch. There's even an airline chime when you open it, because we're extra like that.

**World clocks that actually look good.**
Add cities from anywhere on Earth and watch their times tick in perfect split-flap sync. New York, Tokyo, Tel Aviv, Auckland — wherever your people are, Tock keeps you connected without looking like a spreadsheet.

**Weather, because why not.**
Each city shows current temperature and conditions with minimal weather icons. Powered by Open-Meteo — no API key, no account, no nonsense. It just works.

**Home screen widgets.**
Small widget shows the time. Medium widget shows the time with seconds, city name, and AM/PM. Both look like tiny split-flap boards on your home screen. Finally, a widget that sparks joy.

**Customize everything.**
Toggle seconds on or off. Switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius. Add any city, remove any city. It's your clock — we just made it pretty.

**The highlights:**
- Stunning split-flap animation with real physics
- Power-on cascade effect on launch
- Airline chime startup sound
- 12-hour format with AM/PM
- Multiple world clocks with live weather
- Home screen widgets (small & medium)

**Privacy-first. Always.**
Tock runs entirely on your device. The only network requests are to Open-Meteo's free weather API — no accounts, no tracking, no analytics. We don't collect your data because we genuinely don't care what time zone you're stalking.

Stop checking the time on a boring digital clock. Let Tock make it an experience.
