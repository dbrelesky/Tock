# Privacy Policy — Tock

**Last updated:** February 22, 2026

## The short version

Tock doesn't collect your data. Period.

## What data we collect

None. Zero. Zilch.

## Network requests

Tock makes requests to the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) to fetch weather data (temperature and conditions) for the cities you configure. These requests contain only city coordinates (latitude/longitude) — no user identifiers, device IDs, or personal information of any kind.

Open-Meteo is a free, open-source weather API that does not require authentication or API keys. Their privacy policy is available at [https://open-meteo.com/en/terms](https://open-meteo.com/en/terms).

## Data storage

All user preferences (city list, seconds toggle, temperature unit) are stored locally on your device using the browser's localStorage. This data never leaves your device.

## Analytics & tracking

Tock does not include any analytics, crash reporting, advertising, or tracking SDKs.

## Third-party services

Tock does not integrate with any third-party services other than Open-Meteo's public weather API as described above.

## Children's privacy

Tock does not collect any data from anyone, including children.

## Changes to this policy

If this policy changes, updates will be posted here. But honestly, "we collect nothing" is a pretty hard policy to change.
